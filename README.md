Satellite Image Segmentation for Road Extraction
This repository contains code for a satellite image segmentation project aimed at road extraction using deep learning techniques. The project involves training a segmentation model on satellite imagery data and making predictions on new satellite images to identify road areas.

Overview
Satellite image segmentation is a computer vision task that involves partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions to simplify its representation. In this project, we focus on segmenting satellite images to identify road areas, which is crucial for various applications such as urban planning, transportation management, and infrastructure development.

Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

data/: Contains the metadata, dataset splits, and other data-related files.
models/: Stores trained segmentation models and related files.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
src/: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, inference, and evaluation.
utils/: Utility functions and scripts used across the project.
Getting Started
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/satellite-image-segmentation.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd satellite-image-segmentation
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Training
Prepare your dataset by organizing satellite images and corresponding masks.

Update the metadata file (metadata.csv) with the paths to satellite images and masks.

Run the training script:

bash
Copy code
python src/train.py --data_dir data --model_params params.yaml
Inference
Prepare the satellite image you want to perform inference on.

Update the path to the model checkpoint in the inference script (inference.py).

Run the inference script:

bash
Copy code
python src/inference.py --image_path /path/to/satellite/image.tif
