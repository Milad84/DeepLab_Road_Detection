This repository contains code for a satellite image segmentation project aimed at road extraction using deep learning techniques. The project involves training a segmentation model on satellite imagery data and making predictions on new satellite images to identify road areas.

## Overview

Satellite image segmentation is a computer vision task that involves partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions to simplify its representation. In this project, we focus on segmenting satellite images to identify road areas, which is crucial for various applications such as urban planning, transportation management, and infrastructure development.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **`data/`**: Contains the metadata, dataset splits, and other data-related files.
- **`models/`**: Stores trained segmentation models and related files.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- **`src/`**: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, inference, and evaluation.
- **`utils/`**: Utility functions and scripts used across the project.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/satellite-image-segmentation.git

Usage
Data Preparation
Before training the model, you need to prepare your dataset by organizing satellite images and corresponding masks. The dataset should be split into training, validation, and possibly test sets.

Model Training
To train the segmentation model, follow these steps:

Update the metadata file (metadata.csv) with the paths to satellite images and masks.

Run the training script:
python src/train.py --data_dir data --model_params params.yaml

Monitor the training progress and evaluate the model performance using the provided metrics.

Inference
After training the model, you can use it to make predictions on new satellite images:

Prepare the satellite image you want to perform inference on.

Update the path to the model checkpoint in the inference script (inference.py).

Run the inference script:

python src/inference.py --image_path /path/to/satellite/image.tif
Visualize the predicted road areas and analyze the results.


Challenges and Considerations
Data Quality: Satellite imagery data may contain noise, artifacts, or variations in lighting and weather conditions, which can affect model performance.
Model Complexity: Designing an effective segmentation model requires careful consideration of architecture, hyperparameters, and optimization techniques.
Computational Resources: Training deep learning models on large datasets can be computationally intensive and may require access to powerful hardware or cloud computing resources.
Evaluation Metrics: Choosing appropriate evaluation metrics to assess model performance is essential for reliable results.
